# AdventOfCode 2022 - Go

## Description

Of the good, the bad, and the ugly, this is the ugly ... I mean it works, so it can't be all bad ... lol. This is the code that I wrote for [Advent Of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). First time working with Go.

## Running the code

- The file structure is ./src/[day]/[part], e.g. ./src/01/01 for day 1, part 1.
- Change into the folder containing the code to run.
- Run `go run ./main.go` to run the final result.
- Run `go test` to run the test against the test input text file.
